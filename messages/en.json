    "body": "We have both experienced how a personal song can make a grieving process a bit softer, a bit warmer, and a bit closer. Over the years, we have written such songs for family and friends, and thus seen how music can create a very special atmosphere when it reflects a life that has been lived.\n\n A remembrance song can tell a story, carry a memory and give space for feelings that cannot always be expressed in words alone. This experience and the certainty of music's power is why we want to create such songs for you too.\n\n From this, we create a personal song that tells their story – in a gentle, emotional and lasting way.",
